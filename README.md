# CarParking System
 Â  # The endpoint is being calculated base on Direction Mapping as follows

     * As per the direction, the direction mapping has been configured in the code.
            Ex. For North -> Left is West, Right is East
                    East -> Left is North, Right is South


     * Based on the input( left or right) the current direction will be identified and indexes
       Vertical and Horizontal will be adjusted as follows
                  - If the direction is North , vertical+1
                    If the direction is South , vertical -1
                    If  the direction is East , Horizontal+1
                    If  the direction is West , Horizontal-1
